I am a BS/MS Student in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech. 
My interest areas include Computer Architecture, Embedded Systems, and Telecommunication, and I also pursue 
personal projects related to machine learning and web applications. 
I plan to log most of my future projects and learnings in my [blog](http://peter765.github.io/blog/). 

In my spare time, I enjoy volunteering for community efforts like Project Open Hand and Habitat for Humanity. I also try to 
stay involved on campus by helping with Regional Science Olympiad, Residence Hall Association, and Freshman Move-In. 
To keep things interesting, I also occasionally dabble in cooking, learning Japanese, and music theory. 

I find the most fun in my field by learning from projects and people and sharing what I have learned through 
teaching assistantships, group projects, and hackathon mentoring. I hope to eventually lead larger projects and work with 
people with diverse backgrounds and skillsets.
